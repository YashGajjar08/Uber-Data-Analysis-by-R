# Uber Data Analysis using R

Uber is the company behind the data for transporting people and making deliveries easy, with over 118 million customers, 5 million drivers, and 6.3 billion journeys conducted per day. 
How are drivers efficiently assigned to riders, and how is dynamic pricing used to balance supply and demand? 
Because of the large volumes of data collected by Uber and the fantastic team that handles Uber data analysis using machine learning tools and frameworks.
if you're curious about how data analysis is done at Uber to ensure positive experiences for riders while making the ride profitable for the company, get your hands dirty working with the Uber dataset to gain in-depth insights.




- Data storytelling is a key component of Machine Learning that allows businesses to understand the history of diverse operations. 
- Companies can benefit from visualization by analyzing complex data and receiving insights that will help them make decisions. 
- This is more of a data visualization project that will teach you how to use the ggplot2 library to interpret the data and create intuition for understanding the customers that use the trips.

- In this data analysis, we analyze Uber data from 1st April 2014 to 30th September 2014.

- The purpose of this project is to learn R visualizations.

### The essential packages that we will use in this Uber data analysis project:

#### ggplot2
This is the backbone of this project. ggplot2 is the most popular data visualization library that is most widely used for creating aesthetic visualization plots.
#### ggthemes
This is more of an add-on to our main ggplot2 library. With this, we can create better create extra themes and scales with the mainstream ggplot2 package.
#### lubricate
Our dataset involves various time frames. In order to understand our data in separate time categories, we will make use of the lubridate package.
#### dplyr
This package is the lingua franca of data manipulation in R.
#### tidyr
This package will help you to tidy your data. The basic principle of tidyr is to tidy the columns where each variable is present in a column, each observation is represented by a row and each value depicts a cell.
#### DT
With the help of this package, we will be able to interface with the JavaScript Library called â€“ Datatables.
#### scales
With the help of graphical scales, we can automatically map the data to the correct scales with well-placed axes and legends.
